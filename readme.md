I'm Arto
a learning programmer

Hello World!

I'm learning a web-development and inventing a machine for creating audio cassettes. I also organize an amateur film festival. Sometimes I make photo-conceptual books about what we see around us in our daily life.

My Skills

Great learning ability
I learn something new all the time and all knowledge comes to me quite easily. So I am quite sure that I will become a web developer soon.

Ping pong
I am a good ping-pong player. I enjoy this activity very much, and fortunately, I live in a city where there are table tennis tables on every corner.

Get in touch

if you want to play ping pong with me.

And on the way to the site, I'll tell you about my latest development projects. You'll probably like both.
